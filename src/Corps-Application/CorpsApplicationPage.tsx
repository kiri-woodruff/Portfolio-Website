                <h3>What I Did</h3>
                The Digital Corps wanted to update their application site so I was tasked with styling the page with the new design.
                The site used an old version of Angular so I had to learn how to read the code that was already there and add to it
                to fit our purposes.
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}
